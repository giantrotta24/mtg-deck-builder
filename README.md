# mtg-deck-builder

A 'Magic: The Gathering' deck builder app built using `create-react-app`.

## Motivation
Being a fan of Magic: The Gathering and the Commander format, I enjoy the process of building decks. I felt like there was a lack of intuative tools to make deck building easier. A lot of times I find myself using a combination of tools like EDHREC, TCGPlayer, a Google document, etc to build a deck list.

The motivation behind this project was to combine some of the functionality of these tools into one application to make deck building easier.
